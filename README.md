# GolangGameOfLife
A very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Go, using functional programming paradigms and terminal output.

# How to Use
To build the project, run "go build" in the same location as "main.go"
The executable takes 2 (optionally 3) parameters:
 - Width (Integer > 4)
 - Height (Integer > 4)
 - Speed (Integer > 0, default 1. Higher will result in a faster simulation speed)
